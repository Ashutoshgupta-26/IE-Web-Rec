# âœ… To-Do List App â€“ React Frontend Clone

A clean, responsive, and interactive **To-Do List App Clone** built entirely using **React.js**.  
This project allows users to **add, complete, and delete tasks** â€” all handled on the frontend, without any backend or database integration (yet).

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project replicates the design and functionality of a modern To-Do list manager using React.  
It focuses on implementing **state management**, **component-based UI**, and **dynamic rendering** using **React hooks**.

Currently, the app works **only on the frontend** â€” task data is stored temporarily (in the browserâ€™s memory) and resets when the page is reloaded.

## ðŸš§ Backend Status

ðŸŸ  **No backend added yet.**  
The app currently runs only on the **frontend** and does not store data permanently.  

## ðŸ’¡ Challenges Faced

- Handling **conditional rendering** and **list updates** without page reloads  
- Designing a **responsive layout** that looks clean across devices
