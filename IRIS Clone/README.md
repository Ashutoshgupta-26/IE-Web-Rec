# ðŸŽ“ IRIS Student Portal Clone â€“ Front Page

A **frontend-only clone** of our collegeâ€™s student portal **IRIS**, designed to replicate the look, layout, and design of the actual websiteâ€™s landing page.  
This project was created as part of my learning journey in **web design and frontend development**.
